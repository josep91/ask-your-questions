        Hi! I'm sure you have a lot of questions. This website will help you in finding your own answers. How do we do that?
        <br>
        First, write down your questions. Make sure to end each question with a question mark (?). When that is done, upload the text file here: 
        <br>
    </span>
    
    <label for="user_questions">Select a file that contains your questions</label>
    <input type="file" id="user_questions" name="user_questions">
    
    <span id="main_text">
        <br>
        Second, pray. "Scripture.. James 1:5." As you pray, write what comes to mind in the boxes below each question.
        <br>
        You can also look on ChurchofJesusChrist.org and ComeUntoChrist.org.

    </span>
    
    <!-- Box for user answers -->
    <br>
    <textarea id="user_answer_box" rows="4">Type your answers.</textarea>
    
    <br>
    <span id="main_text">
        Last, you can download a copy of your questions and answers for safekeeping.
        
    </span>
    <br>
    
    <label for="download_button">Download questions with answers.</label>
    <input type="button" id="download_button" name="download_button" value="Download">

    <span id="main_text">

        Remember to say thank you in your next prayer!
