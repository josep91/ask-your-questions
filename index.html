    <span id="welcome_message">
        Hi! I'm sure you have a lot of questions. This website will help you in finding your own answers. How do you do that?
        <br>
    </span>
    
    <span>
        <br>
        <span class="guide_word">First,</span> write down your questions. Upload a text (.txt) file with your questions.
    </span>
    
    <!-- User uploads file -->
    <div id="file_upload_area">    
        <label for="user_questions">Select a file that contains your questions</label>
        <input type="file" id="user_questions" name="user_questions">
        <br>
    </div>
    
    <span>
        <br>
        <span class="guide_word">Second,</span> find your answers. Here are some ways you can do that:
    </span>
    <ul>
        <li>Pray. James 1:5 in the Bible reads, "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."</li>
        <li>Visit <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/">ChurchofJesusChrist.org</a> and <a href="https://www.comeuntochrist.org/">ComeUntoChrist.org</a>.</li>
        <li>Ask your parents for advice.</li>
        <li>For technical or knowledge-based questions, try asking a teacher, looking in a book, or using a Google search.</li>
        <li>If you don't know the answer, it's okay to put "I don't know."</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="user_questions_area" id="user_questions_and_answer_boxes">
        <span id="my_questions_title">My Questions</span><br>
        <span id="user_questions_from_file">
            Your questions will be shown here.
        </span>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Box for user answers -->
    <br>
    <textarea id="user_answer_box" rows="4" >Type your answers here.</textarea>
    
    <br><br>
    <span>
        <span class="guide_word">Third,</span> download a copy of your questions and answers for safekeeping.
    </span>
    <br><br>
    
    <div id="download_file_area">
        <label for="download_button">Download questions with answers</label><br>
        <input type="button" id="download_button" name="download_button" value="Download">
    </div>
    
    <br>
    <span>
        <span class="guide_word">Last,</span> remember to say thank you to the people who helping you find answers. Don't forget to pray (as appropriate)!
